# Why Your Gillette Business Isn't Showing Up on Google

Last week, a frustrated restaurant owner called me. "Kellee, I've been in business for 15 years. Everyone knows us in Gillette, but when people search for restaurants, we're nowhere to be found on Google. What gives?"

This conversation happens more often than you'd think. Established Wyoming businesses with great reputations are invisible online, while newer (sometimes inferior) competitors show up first.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. And more importantly, it's fixable.

## The Hard Truth About Local Search

Here's what's happening: **Your customers are Googling before they buy.**

Even if they've heard of your business, they're still searching to:
- Check your hours
- Read reviews
- Get directions
- Compare options
- Find your phone number

If you're not showing up in those searches, you're losing customers to competitors who are.

## The 5 Mistakes Keeping You Invisible

### 1. Your Google Business Profile is a Mess (Or Doesn't Exist)

This is the big one. Your Google Business Profile is your digital storefront, but most Gillette businesses treat it like an afterthought.

**Common problems I see:**
- Incorrect business hours
- Wrong phone number or address
- No photos (or terrible ones)
- Empty description
- Not responding to reviews

**The fix:** Claim your profile, fill out every field completely, and keep it updated.

### 2. You're Not Using Wyoming-Specific Keywords

You might think you're a "construction company," but your customers are searching for "construction companies in Gillette" or "Wyoming contractors."

**What to do:**
- Include "Gillette" and "Wyoming" in your website content
- Create pages for specific services with local keywords
- Write about local projects and community involvement

### 3. Your Website Wasn't Built for Local Search

Many Wyoming businesses have beautiful websites that Google can't understand or find.

**Technical issues I find constantly:**
- No local schema markup
- Missing or incorrect NAP (Name, Address, Phone) information
- No location pages
- Slow loading times

### 4. You Have Zero Online Reviews (Or You're Ignoring Them)

Reviews are huge for local search. Businesses with more positive reviews consistently outrank those without.

But here's what most don't realize: **It's not just about having reviews—it's about actively managing them.**

### 5. You Think "Everyone Already Knows Us"

This is the killer. You assume that because you've been in Gillette for decades, you don't need to worry about online visibility.

Meanwhile, new residents, younger customers, and people from neighboring towns are all searching online first.

## The Gillette Advantage (That Most Businesses Waste)

Here's the good news: **Competition for local search in Wyoming is relatively low.**

In Denver or Cheyenne, you're competing with hundreds of businesses. In Gillette, you might be competing with 10-20.

This means small improvements can lead to dramatic results.

## Real Success Story

Let me tell you about Jim's Welding (name changed for privacy). When we started working together:
- He wasn't on the first page for "welding Gillette"
- Had 3 Google reviews
- Website got maybe 10 visitors a month

Six months later:
- #1 result for multiple welding-related searches
- 47 five-star reviews
- Website traffic increased 300%
- **Most importantly:** 40% more customers from online searches

**What we did wasn't complicated.** We just did the basics correctly and consistently.

## Your 30-Day Action Plan

### Week 1: Google Business Profile
- Claim and verify your profile
- Add accurate business information
- Upload high-quality photos
- Write a compelling business description

### Week 2: Website Optimization
- Add location information to your homepage
- Create service pages with local keywords
- Make sure your contact info matches everywhere
- Test your site speed (aim for under 3 seconds)

### Week 3: Review Strategy
- Ask satisfied customers for reviews
- Set up a system to request reviews after jobs
- Respond to all reviews (good and bad)
- Address any negative feedback professionally

### Week 4: Content Creation
- Write a blog post about a local project
- Create a "Serving Gillette and Surrounding Areas" page
- Add customer testimonials with locations
- Share community involvement

## The Local Search Opportunity

Most Gillette businesses are making these same mistakes. That's your opportunity.

While your competitors are hoping people will "just find them," you can dominate local search results with basic best practices.

## Common Excuse (And Why It's Wrong)

**"My customers don't use Google."**

Yes, they do. Even your 60-year-old customers are Googling your business hours before they drive over. Even your long-time customers are checking Google Maps for directions.

The question isn't whether your customers use Google—it's whether they find you or your competitors when they do.

## Getting Started

You don't need to do everything at once. Start with your Google Business Profile—it's free, takes an hour, and can show results within days.

But if this feels overwhelming, or if you've tried some of this before without success, that's where I come in.
